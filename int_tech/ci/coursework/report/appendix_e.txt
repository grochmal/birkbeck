Appendix E: Resources on R and GNU Octave

R is a programming language for analysis and manipulation of statistical data
(Maltoff, 2011).

R is available for download from the Imperial College London at
http://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk or from other mirrors, which can be found under
http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html.  A good, freely available, resource for
understanding R is the introduction to R manual available on the R
documentation at: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html

GNU octave is a command line interface for solving linear and non-linear
numerical problems (Hanses, 2011).  It is mostly compatible with Matlab (GNU,
2013).  In this coursework the Matlab code was written and tested under GNU
Octave before being run in the laboratories providing the Neural Network Matlab
Toolbox.

Resources on GNU octave can be obtained from the GNU website on
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave.  The download is freely available at
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html and the Octave manual (see
Eaton, 2007) can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter
