Introduction

This work is the result of the coursework assignment from the Computational
Intelligence module during the Spring term of 2013, on the Birkbeck University
of London.  It discusses the classification of colonoscopy video frames for
the purpose of discovering abnormal textures, this way helping in the
diagnosis of colon cancer.  As required by the coursework, the approach taken
is to use artificial neural networks to perform the classification.  Many
network configurations where tested and the comparison between these is
discussed throughout this work.
