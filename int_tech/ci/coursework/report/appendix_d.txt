In accordance to the section 11: Exploitation of the coursework outputs of the
coursework assignment the coursework output is Copylefted.  This means that
the Copyright of the work is extended to any person receiving the work,
including the College.

The two statements mentioned in the coursework assignment are fulfilled by the
license under which the work is distributed.  The first statement: "if a
student, in the course of studies, produces any original works (including
computer software) which may be commercially exploitable, the College shall be
entitled to the copyright in such works and shall use its best endeavours to
secure royalties." is fulfilled by the fact that the college receive the
copyright of the work, just as any other person or institution that receives a
copy of the work.

The second statement refers to the use of the Deed of Assignment for the
assignment of the rights of copy or patent to any work that might prove
potentially valuable.  The fulfilment of the Deed of Assignment is inherited
from the license of the work: as the rights of copy are provided to the College
(as for any other person or institution that receives a copy of the work) and
as patents for software are not applicable in the European Union.
