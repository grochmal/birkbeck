I am interested in research projects because of the uncommon nature they have.
Research requires a lot of creativity and dedication, therefore I believe that
I can better explore Artificial Intelligence techniques if I work on a research
project that uses them.  Moreover, difficult data is needed if I want to
explore AI techniques deeper, and biological data is difficult.

The exact techniques I'd like to explore are intelligent systems that operate
on huge amounts of either structured or unstructured data.  Interesting
structured data are, for example, genomics and proteomics.  Three good public
datasets in this area are the denisova, ensembl and 1000 genomes.  Integration
between these three datasets is a challenging problem.

On unstructured data, feature extraction is an area of much turmoil in the
recent years.  The advances in deep learning allow for features to be learned
from the data, and in recent experiments learned features perform better than
hand crafted ones in certain domains.  Comparison of hand crafted features and
learned ones in multimedia data is a promising area for research.

I am working with Prof. Dell Zhang in a project of feature extraction in the
Computer Vision area.  I have strong background in the programming tools
used/preferred by Prof. Zhang, and I believe he would be interested in the
development of data integration algorithms in the cloud.
