<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
<em>GNU/Linux</em> is the <em>OS (operating system)</em> of choice of most
hackers, widely used by programmers and adopted by vast majority of web
servers.  The article below gives a gentle introduction into the intricacies of
this OS.

<h2 id="why-gnu">1. Why GNU/Linux?</h2>
<p>
For ideological reasons I've been using GNU/Linux as the operating system on
all my machines for more than 10 years.  Nowadays it is hard for me to use an
OS that is not UNIX based.  When confronted with a machine running MS Windows I
miss the power of the command line.  From this we can argue that using a
GNU/Linux OS (or any POSIX compliant UNIX operating system) have advantages
that are not only ideological.
</p>
<p>
This document will describe advantages of a fully customisable OS as opposed to
a out of the box OS which is often hard to troubleshoot.  I assume you are
familiar with computers and have some basic background in programming (you
wrote a hello world in two different programming languages), yet if you miss
such background please see the bottom of this document for links to documents
that might be of use to acquire it.
</p>
<p>
If there are advantages in learning how to use a UNIX based operating system as
an OS for personal machines there are many more advantages in knowing your way
around a UNIX OS as a professional working with computers.  Almost all web
servers today run on UNIX based operating systems (with a wast majority running
on GNU/Linux) as do most wide scale applications like banking transaction
systems or databases (most systems in the financial sector run either on UNIX
or on mainframes).  The main reason for these facts is the reliability and
backward compatibility these OSes provide.  Knowing your way around a UNIX
based system do improve your CV.
</p>
<h2 id="distros">2. Selecting a distro</h2>
<p>
To start our adventure with GNU/Linux you will need to get hold of a copy of
it.  There are many communities on the internet distributing copies of
GNU/Linux, we call these copies different <em>flavors</em> of GNU/Linux.  Some
flavors are very friendly others might require you to be an expert hacker to
simply install the OS, choosing the wrong flavour may throw you off GNU/Linux
simply because that flavour is too complex for a first experience.  Most
flavours of GNU/Linux are free and can be downloaded from the web pages that
distribute them.  These flavours are called <em>GNU/Linux distributions</em> or
<em>distros</em> for short.
</p>
<p>
I assume you're interested in running GNU/Linux on your machine if you're
reading this article so far.  From here the next step is to decide on a distro
that will not be painful for a first time user.  Later we will also discuss a
little on the hardware GNU/Linux can run on (don't be scared, it is probably th
OS that can run on most machines).
</p>
<h3 id="distro-list">Which distro shall I pick?</h3>
<p>
One way of finding a suitable distro would be to go to <a
href="http://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">distrowatch</a>, read the almost
exhaustive articles that can be found there about distros and armed with that
knowledge select one.  But I'll give you some suggestions below in a more
succinct way, these are rather user friendly distros:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> is probably the
distribution with the latests versions of software in it.  This is a double
edged sword, because you get the newest bug fixes fast but you also get the new
bugs.  The Fedora distro is used by <em>Red Hat Linux</em> (see below) as
experimentation ground for it's own flavour of GNU/Linux.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://crunchbang.org" target="_blank">CrunchBang</a> recently became
a very popular distro because of it's lightweight and minimalistic basic
install.  It is an ideal distribution for machines with little processing
power.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> is a very popular and
robust distro.  It is commercially focused, which allows it to run on
proprietary hardware but does not allow full customisability.  Ubuntu is not a
hacker's OS.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank">Red Hat</a> is not a distro
but a commercial GNU/Linux OS.  It is extremely robust and one of the most used
OSes to run business applications.  Yet, it is not a good OS for a personal
machine.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://www.scientificlinux.org/" target="_blank">Scientific Linux</a>
is a distro based on the same code as Red Hat but compiled and distributed by
CERN and Fermilab.  It is a distro focused on academia, and for this reason we
will use this distro in the examples below.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://trisquel.info/" target="_blank">Trisquel</a> is completely free
from proprietary software.  Unfortunately this is not a very mature distro yet,
and may crash sometimes.  Although it is very user friendly it is hard to
recommend it for a first experience with GNU/Linux.
  </li>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a> is a distro so
user friendly that it hurts.  Although it's easy to use it lacks the proper
GNU/Linux learning curve.  In other words, once you use any distro above you
will not have problems in switching between distros, but if you use Mint you
still might struggle with other distros because Mint introduces too many user
friendly features.  Use it only if you struggle too much with other distros.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Here we will use Scientific Linux because of it's academic focus, but feel free
to choose another distro if it looks better.  I'll point out where there are
differences between Scientific Linux and other distros (there aren't many).
</p>
<p>
Independently of which distro you decide to go forward with (and not
necessarily it being one from the list above) go to the distribution website
and download a <em>disk image of it</em> All distros in the list above come in
many disk image installation formats: minimal install mini-CD image, full
install on CDs, full install on DVDs, live-CD, live-DVD and sometimes more.
For a first install I recommend a <em>live-CD</em>, because you can boot the
distro and test if all hardware is working before beginning installation.  All
distros in the list above do come in live-CD form.  It is also very important
to choose the OS appropriate for the processor of the machine you plan to
install on.  Almost all personal computers have intel or AMD x86 family
processors, and come in two possible processor <em>architectures</em> 32bit or
64bit instruction set.  Nowadays single core machines almost always use the
32bit instruction set and multi core machines almost always use the 64bit
instruction set.  The 32bit instruction set is named as a <em>i386, i486, i586
and i686</em> processor family (the difference between these is not important
for our purpose) and the 64bit instruction set is normally written as
<em>x86_64</em>.  A 64bit machine can run on both i386 and x86_64 OSes, yet
it's performance will most likely be better when running on a x86_64 OS.  32bit
machines can only run the i386 family of OSes, and will not boot an OS compiled
for a x86_64 processor.
</p>
<p>
For example, the Scientific Linux version 6.4 (latest as of this writing)
distro can be downloaded from the FTP on the main website in the live-CD format
in both i386 and x86_64 architectures.  For the i386 machines you can find it
under the name
<a href="ftp://ftp1.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/livecd/64/i386/SL-64-i386-2013-04-17-LiveCD.iso">
SL-64-i386-2013-04-17-LiveCD.iso</a>, and for x86_64 machines under
<a href="ftp://ftp1.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/livecd/64/x86_64/SL-64-x86_64-2013-04-17-LiveCD.iso">
SL-64-x86_64-2013-04-17-LiveCD.iso</a>.  It is common name convention to
indicate the version, the processor architecture, the type of the release
(live-CD) and the release date in the OS disk image name.
</p>
<h3 id="hardware">The right hardware</h3>
<p>
GNU/Linux distributions are maintained mostly by volunteers and moreover the
hardware drivers and applications are developed and maintained by hackers and
hobbyists.  Therefore drivers for the new hardware technologies released last
week are most likely not present in the OS (to be exact drivers are present in
the kernel i.e. Linux).  It is rare that hardware manufacturers provide drivers
for GNU/Linux, for the reason that it is not run by a company like Microsoft or
Apple which would pay the hardware manufacturer for the driver.  Even worse,
very often hardware manufacturers do not publish the specification of the
hardware and the only way to build a driver for it is by trial and error.  For
all these reasons drivers arrive slowly into GNU/Linux, but don't be taken off
right now there is at least a handful of hackers working on the drivers for
that new hardware released last week and it will become available once they
finish.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the first important tip is to <em>not try running GNU/Linux on the
latest top notch hardware you can find</em>, first of all that hardware is not
mature yet and probably buggy; second, the driver for it might not be complete.
Often volunteers writing drivers for GNU/Linux decide to not write a driver
until the hardware technology is mature.  The most awful example of hardware
that is not mature are 802.11x wireless cards (x standing for g, n or b).
Given the complexity of the link layer of wireless and many proprietary
extensions wireless card manufacturers add new features to their cards all the
time, and often many manufacturers fail to comply with the basic 802.11
standard in the process.  With ever new feature new drivers are needed, and of
course no specs are released.  This is hell for anyone trying to keep a
standardised set of drivers for wireless.  Therefore, the second tip is to
<em>if you want to use a wireless card on your machine make sure it's not the
latest card released last month</em>.
</p>
<p>
Also note that GNU/Linux will run perfectly fine on an old machine.  The memory
imprint of GNU/Linux is little and in contrast to many OSes these days the
imprint did not increase much since the late '90s.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can also run GNU/Linux as a virtual machine if the machine you use
is powerful enough.  Virtualisation simulates a different virtual hardware for
the guest machine and almost all hardware that is simulated by diverse tools is
easily supported by drivers in GNU/Linux.  Some good open source virtualisation
tools are: <a href="http://xenproject.org/" target="_blank">Xen</a> developed
by the University of Cambridge and <a href="http://virtualbox.org/"
target="_blank"> Virtual Box</a> by Oracle.  While Virtual Box is very user
friendly Xen is more robust.  If you have a powerful machine, running your
first GNU/Linux inside a virtual machine is a very wise choice.
</p>
<h2 id="installation">3. Installation</h2>
<p>
By now you have a distribution image disk in your hands (or more exactly on
your hard disk) and you have decided on which machine you will install the
GNU/Linux OS.  Either as a fully flagged OS for the machine or as a guest
virtual machine.  If you wanna install GNU/Linux as a fully flagged OS on your
machine it is possible to install it and still keep the old  operating system
(almost) intact, we will discuss this option shortly.
</p>
<h3 id="install-opts">Where to install?</h3>
<p>
There are three main ways an OS can run on a machine.  The most common
configuration is to have one and only OS on the machine but that is not the
only way a computer can run an OS.  A general purpose computer is capable of
running more than one OS, but not at the same time.  You can have more than one
installed OS and decide which one to boot when you turn your computer on.
Also, with the use of virtual machine you can run an entire computer with a
completely different OS inside the main OS.  Each of the techniques have it's
advantages and disadvantages, which we will discuss here.  Before you begin
installing your new GNU/Linux OS you shall be aware of the options you have for
doing so.
</p>
<p>
There was a time when computers could have installed <em>only one OS</em> at
any given time, this is hardly a limitation anymore on most modern machines.
Yet, an installed OS occupy a big amount of disk space which can be undesirable
on machines with small disks.  Most personal computer vendors sell machines
with only one OS for the easy of use, not because they cannot run two (or
more).  Although running only one OS have the advantage of using less disk
space I do not recommend substituting your current OS by GNU/Linux entirely as
your first experience with it.  If something goes wrong and you lose your
current OS you might want to strangle me for suggesting the use of GNU/Linux in
the first place, and we do not want that.
</p>
<p>
You can install <em>GNU/Linux as a second (or third) OS</em> on your machine,
and then you can boot into GNU/Linux or your old OS whenever you like.  This is
possible when installing GNU/Linux last, as its installation scripts are
crafted to do this, but it is often not possible with other OSes.  The
installation process of an OS is dangerous because if something goes very wrong
the machine might not boot anymore.  <em>Always make a backup before attempting
to install a new OS.</em>  This is the way I'll suggest you to install your
first GNU/Linux, and I'll point out where in the installation process the
choices for this kind of installation are made.
</p>
<p>
Another way to run an extra OS is to run it inside the primary OS as a virtual
machine, as discussed above.  The installation process on a VM (virtual
machine) is much easier, it is as the installation of GNU/Linux as the sole OS
for the machine.  The installation is also safer because if something goes
wrong you just wipe out the VM and create a new one.  But VMs need many
resources from the host machine and the guest machine (running GNU/Linux) runs
slower than it would if it was installed on the host machine itself.  If you
have a very powerful machine and some experience with virtualisation creating a
VM for your GNU/Linux may be a very good choice.  When you're installing
GNU/Linux on a VM you shall perform the installation process as if it were to
be the only OS on the machine (as it will be the only OS on the virtual
machine).
</p>
<h3 id="burn-the-image">Burn the image</h3>
<p>
If you're not going to virtualise your GNU/Linux you need to burn the image
disk to a media like a CD or a USB stick.  If you plan to use a virtual machine
for your GNU/Linux you can ignore this section altogether.
</p>
<p>
Burning the image is the common term used to describe the process of
transforming the distro disk image downloaded into a media from which the OS
can be installed.  This is needed because an OS cannot run while another OS is
being installed (this is not 100% true, but installing a new OS on a machine
while it is still running it's old one is very complex and only possible on a
few OSes).  The machine you plan to install GNU/Linux on will need to boot from
the installation media, without the aid of the current OS.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious way to burn the live-CD image is to use a CD/DVD burner.  Most
OSes come with a CD burner installed by default but if it not the case for your
OS, good alternatives are <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/brasero/"
target="_blank">Brasero</a>, <a href="http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/"
target="_blank">Burn</a> or <a href="http://imgburn.com/"
target="_blank">ImgBurn</a> (one of them will support your OS).  It is
important to burn the live-CD image as a disk image and <em>no as data</em>,
otherwise your machine will not be capable of booting from the CD-Rom.
</p>
<p>
If your machine do not have a CD/DVD-Rom reader (and writer) or you do not want
to waste a CD-Rom on an image you not sure will work, you can "burn" the disk
image to a USB stick.  Contrary to a CD-Rom the USB stick will not be
permanently written with the image, although it will need to be formated before
it can store data once again.  The USB stick needs to be big enough to
accommodate the entire live-CD, a 1GB USB drive for a 700MB live-CD is a good
choice.  To "burn" a disk image to a USB stick the guys at
<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/">pendrivelinux</a> created a very easy
to use application that runs on MS Windows.  But if you already run a UNIX
based OS you can write the live-CD on a USB drive using the
<span class="mono">dd</span> command.  First insert the USB drive and run:
<span class="terminal">dmesg | tail</span>
One of the lines shall look similar to:
<span class="terminal">sd 2:0:0:0: [sdX] Attached SCSI removable disk</span>
Where the <span class="mono">X</span> will be a lowercase letter.  Make note of
this label, if you mistype it later you may erase your file system.  Now in the
same directory where the disk image is do:
<span class="terminal">
dd if=SL-64-i386-2013-04-17-LiveCD.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M</span>
Substituting the <span class="mono">X</span> with the correct label and the
disk image with the image you downloaded.  Note the this will erase everything
on the USB drive, and that it is a process that might take some time to
complete.
</p>
<h3 id="boot-gnu">First boot into the new OS</h3>
<p>
With the installation media in hand, shutdown your machine (you might want to
print part of this document before doing that as you will not be able to open a
browser for some time).  If you are installing GNU/Linux on a virtual machine
instead of shutting down the machine prepare to start the VM.  Insert the media
(CD or USB) into the appropriate drive and start the machine (for a VM insert
the disk image into the virtual CD drive).
</p>
<p>
Once the machine starts booting you need to enter the BIOS menu to configure
the drive from which the machine shall boot.  To enter the BIOS menu you need
to press the <span class="mono">ESC</span> key just after pressing the power
button, the key you need to press is different on some machines but is normally
displayed on the first screen (I've seen machines that enter the BIOS menu by
pressing the <span class="mono">F2</span>, <span class="mono">F8</span> or
<span class="mono">F12</span> keys).  Once you reach the BIOS menu find an
option called boot order and set the CD-Rom drive or the USB stick at the first
position.  Save the changes in the BIOS menu and the machine shall reboot by
exiting the BIOS menu.  After changing the boot order the machine shall boot
from our installation media, if it does you shall see a screen with the name of
the distro.  If you used a live-CD select the option to try the distro without
installing, otherwise select the install to disk option and jump to the next
section.  Actually if your machine have little memory (I mean very little, less
than 1/2 GB of memory) it might be wise to select the install option instead of
the live try without installing, as that option requires loading the entire OS
into memory.
</p>
<p>
If you are booting GNU/Linux in a virtual machine there is no BIOS menu as the
BIOS is part of the virtualisation software.  You will need to find the boot
order options inside the VM configuration and set it to the CD-Rom drive.
</p>
<p>
If the machine do not want to boot from the GNU/Linux media but boots its old
OS you probably did not setup the boot order correctly.  Try setting the drive
with GNU/Linux as the only one in the boot order, and if then the machine does
not boot at all cross check that the media is correctly written.  If you can
see the disk image on the media as a file your CD-Rom or USB stick have the OS
written as data and not as an image, go back to the <a href="#burn-the-image">
burn the image</a> section.
</p>
<p>
Your new GNU/Linux shall boot into a graphical environment, it is the best
moment to check that everything is working.  For example, try changing the
screen resolution, play sounds and connect to the network.  Do not worry about
finding each piece of configuration yet, the configuration of the live boot
will be lost once you reboot the machine so do not bother with it.  If
something does not work try searching the web for a solution, for example
sometimes the driver for your sound card is present but is badly identified by
the boot scripts.  Try searching using the name of the vendor of the hardware
that is not working the version of the hardware and the name and version of the
distro you're trying out.
</p>
<p>
Once the OS seems alright click the installation button.  Most distros have an
icon called "install to disk" on the desktop during the live session.
</p>
<h3 id="anaconda">Installation process</h3>
<p>
The installation screens are fruits of a scripting engine called <em>
anaconda</em>, almost all distros nowadays use anaconda to perform the
installation.  Either is you had chosen the installation on the first (after
the boot) screen or if you clicked the install to hard drive button in the live
session anaconda will be triggered.
</p>
<p>
The first couple of screens will led you through selecting the language, the
keyboard layout and the hostname of the machine.  Do not worry about the
hostname, if this is your personal machine leaving it as localhost.localdomain
is perfectly fine.  The scripts will also ask you for a location to determine
the timezone where the machine runs.  On some distros here anaconda asks for a
password for the root user.  The root user is the reason UNIX is called UNIX.
GNU/Linux (and UNIX in general) is a multiuser system, with permissions of
access between the different users.  But one user, the root user, is a special
user that can do everything on the system bypassing anyone else's permissions.
On a UNIX system there is always one and only one such user it is the one (uno)
in the UNIX.  It is wise to setup a strong password for the root user, but not
an impossible to remember one as it is the user you will use to do the
maintenance on your machine.  Some distros (notably Ubuntu) discourage the
setup of a password for the root user altogether, these distros use sessions
with root permissions to allow you to do the maintenance.
<!-- We will look at users and permissions in section 5. -->
</p>
<p>
Next is the decision of how the system shall be installed on your machine, the
most common options configured in anaconda by the distro maintainers are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="padding:3px;">
<em>Use entire drive</em> and <em>replace existing system</em> are good options
to run the GNU/Linux system as the only OS on the machine.  This is a good
choice when installing on a virtual machine.  Most likely you do not have a
UNIX system already present on the machine so the replace existing system
option might not appear.  On the other hand, if you are installing GNU/Linux on
the machine directly and want to keep the original OS these options are a poor
choice.  Using the entire disk for your GNU/Linux is a good choice for a first
experience with it, but if the machine will need to perform specific tasks
(like a web server) a different layout is desired.
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Use free space</em> and <em>shrink current system</em> will place your GNU/Linux
next to the existing OS
  </li>
  <li>
A <em>custom layout</em> is needed when the machine is to be optimised for a specific task.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
After the layout of the system is decided the installation process will copy
the necessary files to disk, it is a process that may take some time.  With the
copy complete it will ask you to configure the boot manager.  The boot manager
is a small application that runs before the OS is loaded and is used to select
between different OSes to boot.  If you selected any option different from
custom layout for the system layout the defaults that anaconda gives you are
good.  If you choose entire disk install there's only on OS on the boot manager
list, if you choose to use free space for GNU/Linux both OSes will be listed.
You might wanna change the order of the OSes on the boot manager list, that's
all.  A custom layout may need some changes in this screen, the next section
discuss these.
</p>
<h3 id="custom-install">Custom system layout</h3>
<p>
This section deals with the reasons for customising the layout of a GNU/Linux
installation.  But I had not the time to write this section yet.
</p>
<h3 id="anaconda-conf">Boot into your installed GNU/Linux</h3>
<p>
It is time to boot the machine from the disk using the newly installed
GNU/Linux.  If you configured the boot order to the drive with the installation
media first remove the media, and if you needed to remove the hard disk from
the allowed boot devices put it back there now.
</p>
<p>
Once the machine boots you will see a GRUB screen, the boot manager, allowing
you to select GNU/Linux or your old OS (if you opted for keeping it).  Select
the GNU/Linux distro option and a configuration screen shall appear.  These
screens are the last parts of anaconda scripts and will configure the machine
for use as a personal computer.  First you get a welcome screen and then a
screen showing the GNU GPL license, the GPL license is not very long and the
first sections about the reasons for the creation of GPL are especially worth
reading.  After the license you anaconda will ask you to create a normal user
(not root), you will use this user to do most things on this machine: browse
the web, program, write documents.  Choose a username and a decent password,
some common usernames are your first name, your last name, "me" or "myself".
Finally anaconda will ask you for the current time to set on the machine.
</p>
<p>
On some distros anaconda may as you to connect to the network and send a
hardware profile and installation log back to the distro maintainers.  It is
polite to do so, although it is totally optional.  Anaconda shall finally close
and leave you on the login screen, use the username you just created to login
to you GNU/Linux system.
</p>
<p>
If you do not see the GRUB screen with options to choose the OS, chances are
that the device boot order in the BIOS menu is incorrect.  Go back into the
BIOS menu and change the boot order of devices, setting the hard drive as the
first device.  If you can select your distro from GRUB but it fail to boot
something went wrong with the installation, insert the installation media, boot
from it and try performing the install once again.
</p>
<h2 id="shell">4. The shell, and why it is useful</h2>
<p>
Once you login to your system, what shall you do?  What most GNU/Linux hackers
do first on a newly installed OS is to configure a terminal emulator.  The
terminal emulator runs a program called a <em>shell</em> which is a text based
command line with many quirks.  You could say that a shell is a fully featured
programming language.
</p>
<h2>Soon...</h2>
<p>
Before the end of 2013 I hope finding time to extend this page with a short
description of important shell commands.  And, given the fact that many people
may be directed to this page to learn how to install GNU/Linux to install
Hadoop on it, I hope writing an article on Hadoop installation.
</p>
<h2>Useful links</h2>
<p>
Probably the most exhaustive resource on computers and UNIX in general is the
(very dated but still relevant)
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/"
target="_blank">Unix and Internet Fundamentals</a> by Eric Raymond.  For
understanding software building under GNU/Linux is
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html" target="_blank">
Building and Installing Software Packages for Linux</a> by Mendel Cooper.
Actually <a href="http://tldp.org/" target="_blank">The Linux Documentation
Project</a> page have many useful tutorials and books on GNU/Linux, for example
<a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/index.html" target="_blank">The Linux
System Administrator's Guide</a> is an almost exhaustive description of the
components and configuration of the GNU/Linux system.

This page is under a very slow migration (as I find time to do it) from the
defunct geosites.  And, to make things worse, I'm adding new things to the page
at the same time as migrating it.  Therefore, I am sure there are lost of typos
and inconsistencies on this and other articles hosted here.  Many thanks for
pointing them out if you find them.
