/*
Graph Attributes

    label="My Graph"; Label a graph itself
    rankdir=LR; Lay the graph out from Left to Right, instead of Top to Bottom
    {rank=same; a, b, c } Group nodes together at the same level of a graph
    splines="line"; Force edges to be straight, no curves or angles
    K=0.6; Used to influence the 'spring' used in the layout, Can be used to
           push nodes further apart, which is especially useful for twopi and
           sfdp layouts

Vertex Attributes

    [label="Some Label"] Labels the Vertex
    [color="red"] Colors the Vertex
    [fillcolor="blue"] Fills the Vertex with the specified colour

Edge Attributes

    [label="Some Label"] Labels the Edge (Useful for Weights)
    [color="red"] Colors the Vertex (Useful for Paths)
    [penwidth=2.0] Adjusts the thickness of the edge line,
                   Very useful for Paths


Edges may also have a weight attribute, defined as [weight=0.5] for example,
but note that this doesn't display the weight directly, It instead acts as a
hint to the graph layout to give this edge a more direct routing.

    b [shape=box];
    // These edges both have different line properties
    a -- b -- c [color=blue];
